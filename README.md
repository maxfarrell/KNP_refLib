# KNP_refLib
Gathering barcoding reference sequences for the Kruger National Park

## Scripts

The two scripts to gather sequences from GenBank and BOLD are "GB_BOLD_seq_download.R" which take a list of Latin binomials and download sequences from the rentrez and bold R packages. These can be modified to download reference sequences for other marker genes. Next "CO1_from_GB_mito_genomes.R" follows the same process, but uses rentrez and modified scripts from the PrimerMiner R package to downloadd whole mitochondrial genomes and extract COI sequences.

After downloading the sequences, "format_GB_BOLD_refLib.sh", "generate_taxonomy.R", and "format_refLib_dada_2.R are used to clean up the downloaded FASTA files, generate the taxonomy file, and format for use with dada2's built-in RDP classifer.

Beyond the custom library, additional scripts are included to format the MIDORI and terrimporter COI reference databases for use with dada2. 


## Data

Contains downloaded FASTA files, whole mitochondrial genomes, and species lists generated by the Kruger National Park.

## Output

The "output" folder contains intermediate files, plus the final dada2-formatted reference sequences:

- Kingdom to Genus: "Kruger_Vertebrates_refLib_dada2.fasta"
- Species: "Kruger_Vertebrates_refLib_dada2_species.fasta"
- Phylum to Species: "Kruger_Vertebrates_refLib_dada2_phy2species.fasta"
